   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Select Your Mood**: Choose from predefined moods or enter a custom one
2. **Add Allergies (Optional)**: Specify any food allergies separated by commas - recipes will avoid these ingredients
3. **Specify Ingredients (Optional)**: List specific ingredients you'd like to include - recipes will feature these prominently
4. **Generate Recipe**: Click "Generate Recipe" to get a personalized recipe
5. **View Recipe**: See the recipe name, ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and an explanation of why it matches your mood
6. **Save Recipe**: Save recipes you like to access them later from the saved recipes section

## 📝 Notes

- Recipes are saved to browser localStorage, so they persist across sessions
- The app uses OpenAI's GPT model (gpt-5.6-terra) to generate creative, mood-matched recipes
- All recipes include allergy considerations when specified
- When you provide specific ingredients, the AI will incorporate them into the recipe while still matching your mood
